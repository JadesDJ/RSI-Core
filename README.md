RSI-Core: Autonomous Driver and Module Development



Introduction

RSI-Core is an autonomous system designed for developing and optimizing drivers and modules. It proactively identifies system needs, generates or optimizes code, and deploys solutions with a self-improving feedback loop.

Logger

    Records messages to rsi-core.log and outputs to console.

Logs include a timestamp.

Notifications

    Sends desktop notifications via notify-send for important events.

Compiler

    Compiles C/C++ code into modules or drivers.

Supports g++ for modules and make for kernel modules (.ko files).
Handles compilation errors and logs them.

Device Info

    Gathers detailed information about devices, including bus type (USB, PCI, Block, Net), Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), device class, endpoints, and max packet size.

Uses lsusb, lspci, and ethtool for device probing.

Driver Pattern Analyzer

    Analyzes kernel source code to identify common driver patterns for USB, PCI, Block, and Net devices.

Extracts code templates from existing drivers to facilitate new driver generation.

RSI-Core Class
Initialization and Setup

    Creates necessary directories: modules, bin, knowledge, drivers.

Loads existing modules and knowledge base entries.
Seeds an initial dummy kernel module.
Sets up a Unix domain socket for inter-process communication.

Core Loop

    run(): Starts the main loop, continuously monitoring the system and initiating improvement cycles.

monitor_system(): Scans dmesg for unhandled devices or driver errors and adds them as improvement goals.
start_improvement_cycle(): Processes pending improvement goals, such as generating or optimizing modules.

Driver Generation and Optimization

    generate_driver(const string& device):
        Generates a new driver for a specified device.

Retrieves device information.
Analyzes driver patterns based on the device type.
Constructs driver code using a template and device-specific details.
Deploys the newly generated driver.
Stores driver information in the knowledge base.

optimize_module(const string& module_id):

    Initiates an optimization process for an existing module.

Runs tests against the module to identify failures.
Analyzes failures to determine the root cause and suggested fixes.
Applies patches to the code, mutates tests, and refines introspection and patcher rules based on the analysis.
Stores the new version of the module.

run_tests(const string& module_id, bool is_driver):

    Compiles the module.

Attempts to load kernel modules using insmod and checks dmesg for errors or kernel panics.
Returns a list of failures.

analyze_failures(const vector<json>& failures, const json& introspection):

    Examines test failures against a set of introspection rules to determine the type of error (e.g., compile error, load error, endpoint error, interrupt error, symbol error, ioctl error).

Extracts relevant details like specific endpoints or undefined symbols.

apply_patch(const string& code, const vector<json>& analysis, const json& patcher, const string& driver_type):

    Modifies the module's source code based on the analysis of failures.

Includes logic for adjusting endpoints, adding interrupt handlers, resolving undefined symbols by adding includes or commenting out code, and adding IOCTL handlers.
Can also comment out specific lines causing compile errors.

mutate_tests(const json& tests, const vector<json>& analysis):

    Adds new test cases based on the types of errors encountered during analysis (e.g., test_endpoint, test_interrupt, test_ioctl).

mutate_introspection(const json& introspection, const vector<json>& analysis):

    Updates introspection rules with new error types discovered during analysis, enhancing future error detection.

mutate_patcher(const json& patcher, const string& original_code, const string& driver_type):

    Refines the patcher's ability to apply fixes by storing effective patches for newly identified error types.

store_new_version(...):

    Saves updated module code, tests, introspection, and patcher configurations.

Increments the module version and updates the knowledge base.

deploy_module(...):

    Attempts to compile and load a module or driver.

Tracks load_count, error_count, score, and mutation_attempts for each module.
If deployment fails or errors are detected, adds an "optimize" goal for the module.
Creates system snapshots before deployment.

Command Handling (Socket)

    Listens for commands via a Unix domain socket.

Supports rsi-core goal: to add new improvement goals.
Supports rsi-core driver-explain: to provide details about a specific driver.

Conclusion

RSI-Core represents a robust and adaptive approach to system-level software development, capable of identifying issues, generating solutions, and learning from failures to continuously improve system stability and functionality.
